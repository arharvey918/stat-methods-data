# Starter Data
This repository contains starter data files for a subset of problems in An Introduction to Statistical Methods and Data Analysis (7th edition) by Ott and Longnecker. The files are organized by chapter, and named by problem number. Running one of the SAS programs will produce a data set in the WORK library.

If you find any mistakes or want to add more starter data, feel free to open a pull request or an issue.
